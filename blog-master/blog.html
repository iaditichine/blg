<img style="float:right;" src="leafy.jpg">Leafy green vegetables are an essential part of a healthy diet as they are rich in vitamin C, antioxidants, fibre, calcium, folate and high in protein per calorie. Eating a diet rich in leafy vegetables can offer many benefits including reduced risk of obesity, heart disease and high blood pressure.
</p>
<h4><strong><u>Health Benefits of Leafy Vegatables:</u></strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><em><u>Weight management</u></em>: Most green vegetables are low in calories. You can eat as much as you like without putting on extra weight.</li>
<br>
<li><em><u>Mortality rate</u></em>: Frequent consumption can substantially lower your mortality risk. Leafy greens contain vitamin K, Magnesium, the B vitamins, Calcium, amongst many other essential nutrients. These nutrients are critical for every cell function and hence, prevent the aging process and help us look youthful.</li>
<br>
<li><em><u>Cardiovascular disease</u></em>: Greens are low in fat, high in dietary fiber, and rich in folic acid, potassium, magnesium, vitamin C, and phytochemicals. One extra serving per day can lower the risk of cardiovascular disease by 11%.</li>
<br>
<li><em><u>Type 2 diabetes</u></em>: The high level of magnesium and low glycemic index that can be found in greens is ideal for preventing and treating diabetes. Studies showed that if you increase your intake of greens by just one serving per day, your risk of diabetes is lowered by 9%</li>
<br>
<li><em><u>Bone health</u></em>: The high levels of vitamin K, Magnesium, and calcium in leafy greens produces osteocalcin, the bone builders. Middle-aged women who eat over one serving of greens per day will lower their risk of a hip fracture by 45%.</li>

<h2><strong>Myths About Food and Nutrition</strong></h2>
<img src='food-myth.jpg' style='width:380px;height:300px;'>
<ol>
    <li><strong>If you have diabetes, stay away from sugar and you’ll be fine</strong>
        <ul><li><strong><u>The truth</u></strong>: “All foods have different effects on blood sugar levels,” says nutritionist Robyn Webb. “While sugar is nutritionally devoid, it’s the total number of carbohydrates that may play a role in blood sugar management. So it’s important to monitor blood sugar even after eating whole foods such as fruit, vegetables, and whole grains.”</li></ul>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Fat makes you fat.</strong>
    <ul><li><strong><u>The truth</u></strong>: Fat gets such a bad rap that we often forget there are such things as healthy fats, such as those found in nuts, olive oil, salmon, and avocados, says Nicole Ferring Holovach. Yes, fat grams do contain more calories than carbs or proteins, but fat is still an essential component of our diet. Adds Elise Museles: They “keep you satiated by slowing down the digestion process so you stay full for a longer period of time.”</li></ul>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Eating more protein will lead to bigger muscles.</strong>
    <ul><li><strong><u>The truth</u></strong>: “A myth perpetuated in gyms!” Webb says. “While eating protein is important, eating more than you need is unnecessary. Resistance training and exercises in which you use your body weight as resistance, such as yoga, can lead to a more defined look. But eating a ton a protein is not going to lead to large muscular development.”</li></ul>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Muscle weighs more than fat.</strong>
    <ul><li><strong><u>The truth</u></strong>: “Unless the laws of physics have changed, one pound is one pound is one pound,” says Elana Natker. “The difference is that muscle is denser than fat, so one pound of muscle takes up less space than a pound of fat.”</li></ul>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Egg yolks are bad for you.</strong>
    <ul><li><strong><u>The truth</u></strong>: Don’t waste those yolks anymore—they’re a “goldmine of nutrition,” says Holovach. One yolk contains half of your day’s requirement of choline, which is an essential nutrient for the brain. Plus recent research shows that dietary cholesterol doesn’t affect blood cholesterol levels as much as previously thought, Holovach adds. Eggs for breakfast will fill you up with protein and fat and will keep you from overeating the rest of the day.</li></ul>

<p>
If you are someone who puts a lot of thought into the food you eat, then, the thinking just doubles when you are pregnant. When you are pregnant, you are making food choices for yourself and the baby. Thanks to the way Indian society is, we are never short of advice. You will get those from all sides when you are pregnant. 
<br>
<br>
Sometimes, what two people advice might funnily contradict too. Just laugh it off because we know after a point it may get on to your nerves. That’s why we are here giving you tips backed by facts and science that will help you with your diet during pregnancy.
<br>
<br>
Here are a few things that you should consider eating throughout your pregnancy
</p>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li style="font-size:30px">Fiber</li>
<p>
Wholegrain foods, such as wholemeal bread, wild rice, wholegrain pasta, pulses like beans and lentils, fruit, and vegetables are rich in fiber.
<br>
<br>
Women have a higher risk of developing constipation during pregnancy; eating plenty of fiber is effective in minimizing that risk. Studies have shown that eating plenty of fiber during pregnancy reduces the risk or severity of hemorrhoids, which also become more common as the fetus grows
</p>
<li style="font-size:30px">Calcium</li>
<p>
It is important to have a healthy daily intake of calcium. Dairy foods, such as cheese, milk, and yogurt are rich in calcium. If the mother is vegan, she should consider the following calcium-rich foods; calcium-fortified soymilk and other plant milks and juices, calcium-set tofu, soybeans, bok choy, broccoli, collards, Chinese cabbage, okra, mustard greens, beans, kale, and soynut
</p>
<li style="font-size:30px">Zinc</li>
<p>
Zinc is a vital trace element. It plays a major role in normal growth and development, cellular integrity, and several biological functions including nucleic acid metabolism and protein synthesis.
<br>
<br>
Since all these functions are involved in growth and cell division, zinc is important for the development of the fetus. The best sources of zinc are chicken, turkey, ham, shrimp, crab, oysters, meat, fish, dairy products, beans, peanut butter, nuts, sunflower seeds, ginger, onions, bran, wheat germ, rice, pasta, cereals, eggs, lentils, and tofu.

<h2>Healthy Indian Diet</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p>
Most of us know the main principles of a healthy diet - getting a good balance of the food groups, eating plenty of fruit and veg, keeping topped up on water. But sometimes getting the principles into practice is a bit of a chore - and coming up with healthy meal ideas for breakfast, lunch and dinner on a daily basis can zap your healthy eating inspiration.
</p>
<img src="healthy.diet.jpg" style="width:450px;height:410px;">

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>
Indian diet consists of roti, rice, dal, chutney, pickle, beans and legumes along with meat or chicken or fish.While we know how healthy Indian food is, where we often go wrong with is our over-indulgence in fried Indian snacks. These are usually consumed after 6 pm and result in bulging tummies and high fat percentages. This is the first step towards all kinds of lifestyle issues like diabetes, thyroid, obesity, pcod etc.
<br>
<br>
Some basic tweaks in your everyday diet can help you keep problems at bay.
</p>
<br>
<ol>
<li>
Controlling your portion size: Every extra roti on your plate adds an extra 80-90 calories. Similarly, an additional serving of rice adds 100 calories.
</li>
<br>
<li>
Refrain from fried food: Since we often hog on fried snacks, opting for boiled, steamed, pressure-cooked, sautéed or broiled food. The method of cooking really helps preserve the nutrient quotient of food.
</li>
<br>
<li>
Reducing salt intake: As Indians, we tend to eat dinner post 8 pm. Sodium retains water in the body and hence leads to you feeling groggy in the morning. Since our salt consumption is high through the day, start reducing your intake by half teaspoon.
</li>
<br>
<li>
Spices: Indian cuisine is rich in whole spices. Let your food be cooked with whole spices like kadi patta, cardamom and cinnamon. Rather than using more fat to flavour your food, use spices.
</li>
<br>
<li>
Relying on grains: Don’t only limit yourself to atta rotis, you can try different varieties like bajra, jowar, makki, or dry dals to make delicious rotis.
</li>
</ol>
